# Task ID: 6
# Title: Streaming Response Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add real-time streaming of AI responses as they're generated.
# Details:
Implement streaming response handling using OpenAI's streaming API. Create a component to render incoming tokens in real-time. Set up the client-side state management to handle partial responses. Implement proper loading states during streaming. Ensure the UI updates smoothly as new tokens arrive. Handle potential network interruptions during streaming. Follow the OpenAI_StreamText.md documentation for implementation details.

# Test Strategy:
Test streaming by sending various prompts and observing the real-time response. Verify that the UI updates smoothly without flickering. Test network interruption scenarios to ensure graceful handling.
