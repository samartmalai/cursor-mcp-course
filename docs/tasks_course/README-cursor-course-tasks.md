# Summary
Because we are using LLAMs to generate the PRD, our tasks could be pretty different.
You can use the files in this folder to recreate the same starter environment to get as close to the same code as possible.

# Pre-Requisite
Please watch the TaskMaster videos before proceeding:
- AI Project Management with TaskMasterAI - Part 1
- AI Project Management with TaskMasterAI - Part 2

# Instructions 
1. Select all of the tasks in this folder.
2. Right click and hit copy.
3. Paste them into the `tasks` folder (If you don't have this yet, please see the prerequisite.)
4. Repeat by copy and pasting the `prd.txt` file in this folder to the `scripts` folder.

You can also prompt the cursor agent to do this for you.
