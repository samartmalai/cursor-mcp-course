# Task ID: 2
# Title: Supabase Setup and Database Schema
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up a local Supabase instance and create the database schema for chat sessions and messages.
# Details:
Install Supabase CLI and initialize a local Supabase instance. Create SQL migrations for the chat_sessions and chat_messages tables according to the data models specified in the PRD. The chat_sessions table should include id, created_at, updated_at, and title fields. The chat_messages table should include id, created_at, chat_id, role, content, type, and optional image_url fields. Set up foreign key relationships between tables. Configure Supabase client in the NextJS application.

# Test Strategy:
Run migrations and verify tables are created correctly. Test basic CRUD operations on both tables using the Supabase client. Ensure foreign key constraints are working properly.
