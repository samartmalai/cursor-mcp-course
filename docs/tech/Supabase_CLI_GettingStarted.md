# Supabase CLI
https://supabase.com/docs/guides/local-development/cli/getting-started

Develop locally, deploy to the Supabase Platform, and set up CI/CD workflows

The Supabase CLI enables you to run the entire Supabase stack locally, on your machine or in a CI environment. With just two commands, you can set up and start a new local project:

supabase init to create a new local project
supabase start to launch the Supabase services
Installing the Supabase CLI#

macOS

Windows

Linux

npm / Bun
Install the CLI with Homebrew:

brew install supabase/tap/supabase
Updating the Supabase CLI#
When a new version is released, you can update the CLI using the same methods.


macOS

Windows

Linux

npm / Bun
brew upgrade supabase
If you have any Supabase containers running locally, stop them and delete their data volumes before proceeding with the upgrade. This ensures that Supabase managed services can apply new migrations on a clean state of the local database.

Backup and stop running containers
Remember to save any local schema and data changes before stopping because the --no-backup flag will delete them.

supabase db diff -f my_schema
supabase db dump --local --data-only > supabase/seed.sql
supabase stop --no-backup
Running Supabase locally#
The Supabase CLI uses Docker containers to manage the local development stack. Follow the official guide to install and configure Docker Desktop:


macOS

Windows
Docker settings on Mac: Select Integrated, Virtualization Framework, and osxfs

Alternately, you can use a different container tool that offers Docker compatible APIs.

Rancher Desktop (macOS, Windows, Linux)
Podman (macOS, Windows, Linux)
OrbStack (macOS)
colima (macOS)
Inside the folder where you want to create your project, run:

supabase init
This will create a new supabase folder. It's safe to commit this folder to your version control system.

Now, to start the Supabase stack, run:

supabase start
This takes time on your first run because the CLI needs to download the Docker images to your local machine. The CLI includes the entire Supabase toolset, and a few additional images that are useful for local development (like a local SMTP server and a database diff tool).

Access your project's services#
Once all of the Supabase services are running, you'll see output containing your local Supabase credentials. It should look like this, with urls and keys that you'll use in your local project:

Started supabase local development setup.
         API URL: http://localhost:54321
          DB URL: postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres
      Studio URL: http://localhost:54323
    Inbucket URL: http://localhost:54324
        anon key: eyJh......
service_role key: eyJh......

Studio

Postgres

# Default URL:
http://localhost:54323
The local development environment includes Supabase Studio, a graphical interface for working with your database.

Stopping local services#
When you are finished working on your Supabase project, you can stop the stack (without resetting your local database):

supabase stop
