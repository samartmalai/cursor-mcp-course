# User Notes

####  What is the main purpose of your project?
The purpose is to create a GPT-powered chatbot. It will also use the OpenAI API to create images when the feature is toggled.

#### Who are the intended users?
Anyone who wants to chat with LLMs or generate images.

#### What are the core features or functionalities you want?
1. Chat - can display messages.
2. Stream text respones from OpenAI
3. Toggle image mode
4. User can start a new chat by clicking "New Chat"

#### Are there any specific technologies, frameworks, or platforms you want to use?
- NextJS App Directory @NextJS_AppDirectory.md 
- React/TypeScript - use React official docs.
- TailwindCSS (general styling) â€“ use Tailwind official docs
- ShadUI (for re-usable common components)  - use ShadUI official docs
- OpenAI SDK: @OpenAI_StreamText.md with `gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14`
- OpenAI SDK: @OpenAI_ImageGeneration.md with `gpt-image-1`. Do NOT use Dall-E.
- Supabase Edge functions (Chat functionality)  @Supabase_EdgeFunctions.md
- Supabase Database (store chat messages) @Supabase_Migrations_Local.md  @SUPABASE_COMMANDS.md

I want to use Supabase locally with the CLI. The project structure should be follow a logical, maintainable structure that follows best practices.
- app (nextJS app directory)
--src
---app
----components
----types
- supabase (backend)
--functions
--migrations

#### Any must-have requirements or constraints (e.g., security, performance, integrations)?

Security is important, but let's work on it at the end, as we just need a simplistic, baseline functionality for now to speed up development. We'll focus on securing API keys later.

Focus on simplistic design for now, just for development and basic styling. We'll focus on it at the end.

#### MVP Simplifications
Focus on MVP only. You can mention future improvements as a section but do not add it to the planning stage. 
- No user auth
- No deployment, CI/CD setup needed.
- No testing required yet.- No dark mode/light mode.
- No animations
- No keyboard shortcuts
- Do not optimize API calls/performance.
- Do not need to show past chats

#### Documentation
Reference documentation at key steps to follow exact syntax requirements
For each task, ensure that the appropriate software is installed and configured, e.g.,
- Supabase CLI is installed
- Docker is installed successfully
- NextJS (requires NodeJS)
